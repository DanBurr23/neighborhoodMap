Summary: This is an app that I am planning to use at my current employer, AT&T in San Ramon. The thought is that when people are visiting from other locations, they can use this site to give them ideas on where to go out to lunch. The map shows the AT&T logo where our office is located, and the markers indicate the nearby restaurants which other employees have recommended. 

To use the application: 
You can launch the app by clicking on the index.html file, or by opening it directly from a web browser. 
Once the app opens, you will see a list of restaurants on the left side navigation panel. Clicking on any of these items from the list will guide you to the marker where that location is, and pop up some information about that restaurant. 
If you're looking for a specific restaurant, you can start typing in the filter box and the list will automatically update for the restaurants which match what you have typed in. 
You can also click directly on any of the markers on the map and the info window for the restaurant at that location will pop up. 
To close the existing info windows, you can either click on the "X" in the info window, or simply click anywhere else on the map. 

Project Summary: 
This has been a challenging one. I had to go back and re-watch the knockout videos multiple times, as well as do a lot of online research on the knockout site. 
My biggest challenge was that I spend the last week and a half trying to get the yelp v3 api to work, and had no luck. So I decided to switch to foursquare, which was pretty straightforward to use. 

Current/Future Steps:
If I plan to roll this out to actually be used, I am going to work on the styling a bit to make it look more professional. 
I am also getting a violation which says "Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'mousewheel' event". This doesn't impact the functionality, but I'm trying to fix it
I also plan on re-working this using angular instead of knockout, as I haven't come across many people using knockout
